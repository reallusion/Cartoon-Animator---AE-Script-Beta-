Cartoon Animator - AE Script
This is a AEscript that expedites 2D animation import workflow between Cartoon Animator and After Effects. You can import your animation work processed in CTA to AE effortlessly with just one click. It supports layered and transparent object-based export. By bringing layers of sprite from CTA to AE, users can perfectly edit every element in post production while preserving all animation keys. For users without AE, they can select and group animation assets and export as image sequence then edit in other post production software.

"Improvement of Export to After Effects"
In version 4.5, Reallusion enhances the functionality of Export to After Effects, including:

1. Enablement to export:
   . Audio clip by object(.wav)
   . Camera settings
   . Project sounds 
   . Background image
   . Transparent Video (.mov)

2. Add hierarchical structures to classify objects in projects (same structure as the Scene Manager). With categorized objects, users can choose specific category(s) to export, instead of exporting entire scenes.

3. Rearrange export file folder structure:
        a) users will have a folder and a .json file named after the project name.
        b) In the folder, CTA automatically classifies into 4 folders by file format: Audio / Video / Sequence image / Single Image

4. Users are able to add extra object(s) from CTA to AE without overwriting a current AE project. For more details and instructions, please refer here. 

**Important: you need to install/ update your Cartoon Animator 4 software to version 4.5 to run Cartoon Animator - AE Script
