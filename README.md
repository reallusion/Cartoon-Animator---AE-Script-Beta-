Cartoon Animator - AE Script
This is a AEscript that expedites 2D animation import workflow between Cartoon Animator and After Effects. You can import your animation work processed in CTA to AE effortlessly with just one click. It supports layered and transparent object-based export. By bringing layers of sprite from CTA to AE, users can perfectly edit every element in post production while preserving all animation keys.
